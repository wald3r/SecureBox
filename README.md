# description:
This application is supposed to become some sort of dropbox clone but in a secure way. I want to store and encrypt data as easy as possible. Same goes for retrieval and decryption. Other functionalities can be a password safe, a backup function and so on. The idea is to develop a data center which stores all kind of data and secures it there. Access should be possible via desktop browser and phone.
